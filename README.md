## Overview

This clock app can be used as a screen saver of a more complex application. It shows the user such information as :

- current time based on their timezone
- information about their location based on their IP addess and more specified time details (week number, weekday number and year day number)
- inspirational quote with a possibility to generate a different one

In addition to this, the entire application theme is depended on the current time - between 5AM and 6 PM the user will see a bright design with a daytime background image and after those hours, it will be automatically changed to a nighttime scenery.
